    <h3 style="color:brown;">In 2008, Radcliffe revealed that he has a mild form of the neurological disorder developmental coordination disorder (dyspraxia). 
        
        The motor skill disorder sometimes prevents him from doing simple activities, such as writing or tying his own shoelaces.
         "I was having a hard time at school, in terms of being crap at everything, with no discernible talent", Radcliffe commented.[117]

        In November 2007, Radcliffe published several poems under the pen name Jacob Gershon ‚Äì a combination of his middle name and
         the Jewish version of his mother's maiden name Gresham ‚Äì in Rubbish,
         an underground fashion magazine.[118][119]
         He has had close friendships with his Harry Potter co-stars Tom Felton,[120] Rupert Grint and Emma Watson,
         [121] and is close to his family, whom he credits for keeping him grounded.[122]
        
        In August 2010, Radcliffe stopped drinking alcohol after finding himself becoming too reliant on it.[123]
        
        Radcliffe has stated he is a fan of rap music and has "had an obsession with memorising complicated, lyrically intricate and fast songs." 
        He rapped Blackalicious' 1999 hit Alphabet Aerobics on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 28 October 2014.[124][125]
